# vim every where with touchcursor

righ now work well with QWERTY

my default caps lock set as ESC

set hyper key to space (hold space) is good idea, usually touch typing just use 9 fingers because i just use 1 finger touch space key left thumb alone and you can map more key + easy to press

## Target

* use [touchcursor](https://github.com/donniebreve/touchcursor-linux) for key mapping
* vim user friendly
* easy to press
